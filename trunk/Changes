v0.8    Mon Jan 30 07:05:36 CST 2006
        - added the ability to read raw marc from strings THIS MAY BREAK
          YOUR CODE. pymarc no longer supports passing file paths to the
          MARCReader constructor. You need to simply change:

          reader = MARCReader('marc.dat')

          to:

          reader = MARCReader(file('marc.dat'))
